## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this dashboard is to help hospital management and key stakeholders:

- Monitor the performance of the Emergency Room (ER) using key operational metrics.
- Track patient flow, wait times, and satisfaction to identify service bottlenecks.
- Gain clarity on admission rates and department referrals for better resource planning.
- Make timely, data-driven decisions to improve overall service efficiency.

## 📊 Key KPIs Tracked
| Metric                   | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Number of Patients**   | Total patients visiting the ER daily. Includes a trend line (sparkline) to visualize busy periods. |
| **Average Wait Time**    | Average time patients wait to see a doctor. Helps identify delays and manage scheduling. |
| **Patient Satisfaction** | Average daily feedback score indicating patient satisfaction level. |

## 🔍 Data Analysis & Insights

- **Admission Status**: Total number of patients admitted vs. not admitted.
- **Patient Age Distribution**: Age-wise segmentation of patients (e.g., 0–9, 10–19, etc.).
- **Timeliness**: % of patients seen within 30 minutes (on-time vs. delayed).
- **Gender Analysis**: Gender-wise breakdown of ER visits.
- **Department Referrals**: Most referred departments (e.g., Orthopedics, Cardiology).

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - Slicers and Timelines
  - Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)
  - Charts (Bar, Pie, Area, Donut, etc.)
